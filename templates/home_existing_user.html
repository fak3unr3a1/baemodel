    The vision we had when building bae is lets say when you are alone and you need someone to talk to bae will be their for you.
    Lets say you are also an engineer and you are building the next space rocket that will take humanity to space or to the neighbouring star system and you need someone to be your faithfull assistant throughout your journey. BAE will be interface.
    
    
    <p><strong>1.2 Unpacking the Name: Best Assistant Ever</strong></p>
    <p>- Analyzing the significance of the name "BAE" and its implications for user expectations and interactions.</p>
    bae in full stands for Best Assistant Ever. And when you have BAE you will not need anyone else to help you plan yourself
    <p><strong>Chapter 2: Exploring Key Features</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>2.1 Chat Bot Interface: The Gateway to Interaction</strong></p>
    <p>- Examining the design principles behind BAE's chat bot interface and its role in facilitating natural, conversational interactions.</p>
    
    So bae has a chat interface where you input natural Language and the ai will understand and try its best to answer back appropriately.
    Also the abilities/tasks can be understood by BAE in natural language so when inputing  the new task/ability try to describr to the ai how you will use it. And examples of how you can call it.
    <p>- Highlighting the importance of user experience and intuitive design in maximizing the effectiveness of the chat interface.</p>
    We tried to be minimalistic with the user interface so that the user feels in control when using the aimodel
    
    <p><strong>2.2 Task Integration: Enhancing Functionality with GitHub</strong></p>
    <p>- Understanding the integration of GitHub with BAE and its significance in expanding the assistant's capabilities.</p>
    So bae has a function that installs the GitHub repo then its added to the usertasks folder where it can be accessed by another function and be executed ny another function
    <p>- Exploring the process of submitting tasks to GitHub and the collaborative nature of enhancing BAE's functionalities.</p>
    So when a user calls a taskthe aimodel looks through the query and tries to identify if its supported to answer using the llm or a task by looking through the input the user input when installing the github repo and also try to see the conversation history to see if its appropriate for the query the user had input. Then responds to the query appropriately.
    
    <p><strong>2.3 Functionality Expansion: Tailoring BAE to Your Needs</strong></p>
    <p>- Investigating the flexibility of BAE in adapting to diverse user requirements through functionality expansion.</p>
